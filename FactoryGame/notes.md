# Notes

### Known Bugs
- Maze code sometimes not picking 3 walls fsr

### Possible Bugs
- Players picking up a fuel object on the same frame
- If a thrown fuel object hits a furnace, and a player had picked up a different fuel while it was travelling to the 
	furnace, the player drops their held object for a second

### Changes
- Change fuel shape to be a sphere rather than a capsule to make throwing more consistent

### Additions
- Stealing fuel from other players
	- Maybe jump on their heads to stun and make them drop their fuel
